Hey everyone 

The Marmotverse has successfully encoded a complete Marmot onto the Chia Testnet10 blockchain. It is not an NFT and we are not in a state to begin minting until the standard is complete. What this is a Proof of Concept test that we will, indeed, be able to encode a complete Marmot onto the blockchain. Because we have.

We used a lightly modified variant of a Chia Community Member's open source project to do so https://github.com/trepca/beacon-coin

The launcher ID for the coin is `0x1ce9faace88da94bb6c9bdcf1f9bd7611e46559a326c0a9e85b851f847fdbfc2` if you would like to use the beacon-coin software to read the marmot back.

Congratulations to speedmann for being the first to write a Marmot to the chain and reading it back. As a bit of community fun I will be offering 0.5xch to the first person to put the Marmot on chain into our discord. It is not an image we have shared before.

Congrats to Acevail who successfully decoded the following image from the testnet10 blockchain. 

Now, here is the image we stored on chain and Acevail extracted successfully
