Hey everyone we have the first version of our project plan / roadmap ready for release. You will notice a lot of items are redacted. We have not announced them yet, but they will be coming. Please feel free to ask any questions at all about the public portions of the roadmap.

Our biggest risk to the timeline is that we have 3 distinct 3rd party dependent milestones. Our schedule assumes an aggressive timeline with best-case dates for fast marmots in order to push our team if things are ready quickly. We do not necessarily think they will be. Those 3 milestones are:

1. NFT Alpha Standard release
2. NFT Standard finalization and updates
3. Chia ecosystem gallery readiness

We are planning to be ready when the 3rd parties are, but by planning for the best there is the chance that we will be left waiting on others, and hence you will be waiting on us. All we can say is that if that happens we will be quick out of the gate at every milestone and that you will have your Marmots as quickly as we can deliver them without compromising the quality of the product.

Thank you again for your support of the Marmotverse
