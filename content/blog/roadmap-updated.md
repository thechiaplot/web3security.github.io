Hey Everyone 

Just wanted to share our updated project plan. We are still ahead of schedule, and are approaching most of our baseline goals. Our Artist @ITG-Drew is hard at work and has blown past his deadlines. @Speedmurmeltier | GMT+1 and I have been hard at work on the technology, and have been working with https://xch.gallery/ to get one of the Space Marmots onto the Testnet10 chain in one of their test singletons - so a real NFT and not a coloured coin. We have successfully transferred between users and are analyzing everything. You can see the results of that here: https://xch.gallery/singletons/43e3d026db18995fe41ba98f0de6f7c2ab376084a04272bc20ab0b7131438357

We will be continuing to improve the process, and get a robust plan in place for mint day so we can share that well ahead of time and provide proper expectations. We do know that minting all 2100 right away will be clearly impossible, so we are going to have to create a release schedule after further testing. We will of course share that when we are confident in our timelines.

We will have more to announce this week, some additional technical resources as well as the next community event.

Viva La Marmota!
