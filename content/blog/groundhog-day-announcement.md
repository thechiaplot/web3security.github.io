Hey everyone quick update.

The team is hard at work on the project, and we are going to be releasing the details of the Groundhog Day Marmotverse event very shortly. We have mostly been taking care of technical details and art details and are happy to announce that at last count we had enough art for 2700 unique marmots. Of course we are continuing ahead with even more to make each one even more individualized, but it is an important milestone as we have passed the minimum number require to satisfy our bare minimum requirements.

Stay tuned and Viva la Marmotverse.
