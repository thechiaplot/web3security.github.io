### Who is Chris Dupres

Chris Dupres is an experienced Information Technology and Security professional with decades of experience working for dozens of major organizations, both as an employee and as a consultant.

About a year before starting the Web 3 Security project he started a small blog about the Chia Cryptocurrency called The Chia Plot (https://thechiaplot.net) and has spent the time since studying the Web 3 and Cryptocurrency ecosystem.

In that time he has seen many of the same mistakes made by traditional IT organizations when trying to build lasting infrastructure. Security is a second class citizen, which has been shocking in an industry built off cryptography. 

This project was born from the idea that very few people are shining a light on the Web 3 and Cryptocurrency projects popping up out of the woodwork. From Key Managament, to project deployment practices, to testing / QA / User Acceptance Testing to audits and audit responses we are going to pick up the rocks and inspect the moss underneath.

### What do we do

Each project will be undertaken as a labour of love, and we will not be funded by anyone or their competitors. That is important because we might get pretty mean here about projects that do not tell the truth, or do a poor job with their security.

Projects are going to be judged on 5 main criteria:

#### Codebase

We will review all publicly available code for a number of factors, including (but not limited to): does it do what they say it does? Are there major vulnerabilities in packages they use? Do they respond to bugs and issues? Do they use a clear deployment process?

This is important because so many projects talk a big game about what they do, or will do, but the reality is that they don't actually have much in their github beyond a fork of geth and a simple website.

#### Infrastructure

I will be analysing any infrastructure they run publicly, and any documentation they have produced about internal infrastructure. This will involve expert review, security scans and projects will be judged on both the security and reliability of the infrastructure they run, as well as how critical it is to the operation of their project.

If a project is promising to change the financial future of the globe but do not use a reverse proxy or WAF in front of the web server and run the database with all the financial details of their customers on the same box we will probably have a problem.
